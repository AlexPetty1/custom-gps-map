            <p> About: Custom GPS maps allows you to see your location on uploaded maps. 
                This works by uploading a image of a map, placing two reference points on the image 
                and specifying their GPS location. Your location can then, be shown on the map.
                Click on view to view the map. <br> <br>
                
                Notes: <br>
                - Make sure the map is to scale <br>
                - Your location is only as accurate as your reference points and map
